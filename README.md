## Usage
  
  **Configuration**

  The first task that needs to be perofrmed before start using the tool is configuring Jira domain and credentials. To do so, we need to use `$ jiran config` command which will prompt us to fill required information. Upon completing required questions a `~/.jiran/config.json` file accessable only to the current user will be created.

  To save jira information to config file

    $ jiran config

  To view what is saved in config file
  
    $ jiran config -v

  **Using other commands**

   List all issues for the current user
    
    $ jiran issues 
    
   Transition a task to in progress
    
    $ jiran pick <issue key>
   
   Log time to a task
    
    $ jiran log-time <ABC-12> '<1h 30m>'  -c '[comment goes here]' -d '[YYYY-MM-DD]'

   Time spent for a week defaults to the current week. The value of week is a single number [1, 2, ...] to which how many weeks to go back and see the time logged for that week.

Time logged for current week
  
    $ jiran dashboard 

Time logged for last week
  
    $ jiran dashboard 1
